    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        It is a Python program that fetches the TLE set of the ZARYA component of the International Space Station from <a href="https://celestrak.org/">Celestrak</a>,
        calculates its position on future times, and predicts its orbit based on those positions, then visualizes its trajectory on an interactive map
        using <a href="https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/latest/index.html">Folium</a>. In this blog, I will walk you through the project and
        provide you some important key concepts that will give you a solid understanding of the logic behind the program.
    </p>
    <h3>Why tracking the ISS?</h3>
    <p>
        I always wanted to know about satellites and track their route if possible. Well, one my dreams is now completed :). I know my own reasons
        for creating such a program, I just can't put it in words. But if you are curious about the reason, I can give you this
        poet-like answer if you don't mind:<br><br>
        <q>
            I developed this program to track the ISS because I am fascinated by the intersection of technology and space exploration. The ability to
            observe the ISS as it orbits the Earth not only deepens my appreciation for human ingenuity and scientific achievement but also connects me
            to the broader universe. By tracking satellites, I can engage with the dynamic nature of our planet and the advancements in space technology,
            fostering a sense of wonder and curiosity about what lies beyond our atmosphere. This project allows me to combine my love for programming
            with my interest in space, creating a tangible way to explore and understand the cosmos.

    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
    <h4># What is a TLE set?</h4>
    <p>
        Two-Line Element Set (TLE) is a standardized format used to describe the orbit of a satellite. It consists of two lines of data that include important
        orbital parameters, such as the satellite's position, velocity, and other relevant information at a specific time known as the epoch.

    </p>
    <h4># What is a Geocentric Position?</h4>
    <p>
        A geocentric position refers to a viewpoint or coordinate system that is centered on the Earth. In astronomy, it describes a model where the Earth is
        considered the center of the universe, with celestial bodies like the Sun and planets (or even satellites) orbiting around it.

    </p>
    <h4># What is a Subpoint Position?</h4>
    <p>
        In Astronomy, the subpoint position (or subsatellite point) of a satellite refers to the point on the Earth's surface that is directly beneath the
        satellite at any given moment. It is defined by its geographical coordinates, latitude and longitude. This point is significant because it represents
        the satellite's ground track, which is the path that the satellite appears to trace over the Earth's surface as it orbits.

    </p>
    <h4># What is International Date Line (IDL)?</h4>
    <p>
        The International Date Line is an imaginary line that runs from the North Pole to the South Pole, primarily along the 180th meridian in the Pacific Ocean.
        It serves as the boundary between two consecutive calendar dates, meaning when you cross it, you either gain or lose a day depending on the direction you
        are traveling.

    </p>
    <h3>A Very Important Block of Code</h3>
    <p>
        I can tell that if there was only one important block of code in the script, it would definitely be this: <br><br>
        <img id="code-block-iss-insight" src="images/code_block_iss_insight.png" alt="code_block"> <br><br>
        Let's break it down: <br>
        On line 1, the <code id="code-snippet">orbit_coordinates</code> list holds the trajectory points. On line 2, <code id="code-snippet">future_sat_lon</code>
        variable represents the future longitude of the ISS at a specific time and <code id="code-snippet">orbit_coordinates[-1][1]</code> accesses the last recorded longitude from a list of
        previous coordinates. This line calculates the absolute difference between the current future longitude and the last recorded longitude. If this difference
        exceeds 180 degrees, it indicates that the satellite has crossed the IDL.
    </p>
    <h4># Now, why does it matter?</h4>
    <p>
        When tracking a satellite's position over time, you may encounter situations where the longitude values can "jump" significantly due to the way longitude
        is measured. Longitude is expressed in degrees, ranging from -180 to +180 or 0 to 360. The International Date Line (IDL) is located at approximately 180
        degrees longitude. Crossing this line can cause a sudden change in the longitude value, which can be problematic for visualizing paths on a map. In general,
        handling the IDL problem matters in terms of:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Visualization:</b> If you don't adjust for these jumps, the path drawn on a map could appear discontinuous or erratic, making it difficult to understand the satellite's actual trajectory.</li>
            <li><b>Data Integrity:</b> Ensuring that longitude values are consistent helps maintain data integrity, especially when plotting or analyzing satellite paths.</li>
        </ul>
