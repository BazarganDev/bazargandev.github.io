    <hr>
    <p>
        <span id="paragraph-begin">W</span>hen I was around the age of 14, it was during the COVID-19 pandemic and we were studying school lessons online.
        But my dumbass would not attend in classes and just spend whole day learning Python and programming. Well,
        I didn't like the school at the first place but I wasn't into studying. But I'm being honest, I never dropped in any lesson or grades.
        <br><br>
        Anyways, here is how I learned Python basics:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Books:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e/">"Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Python-How-Program-Parts-B/dp/0130923613">"Python: How to Program" by Paul Deitel & Harvey Deitel</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Online Resources:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.learnpython.org/">Learn Python</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.harvardonline.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-programming-python">CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKHEtdqhLK8">Bro Code's Full Python Course</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Please note that you can not and will not learn Python just by only watching these videos or studying them. It is like swimming. You can't just
        watch some swimming tutorials then expect to know how to swim properly. You must jump into the water, maybe drown a little bit, then come back to surface.
        Learning Python is the same except there is no water in your system! Just kidding ;)<br>
        You have to do some projects, fail, then fix them. Then do some other projects, then fail again and again and again, until you succeed. You have to solve
        your own projects' problems with your own solutions. You do that and You will know how to program in Python.
