                Hi there!<br>
                My name is Mohammad Bazargan, and I'm currently a student pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering. I have a strong passion for Cybersecurity and ethical hacking, and I'm always eager to learn more about the latest trends and technologies in the field.
                When I'm not coding or studying, I love to travel and explore new places, as well as dive into interesting topics that expand my knowledge.
            </p>
